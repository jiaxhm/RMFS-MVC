Multi-View Clustering Based on Riemannian Manifold Feature Space for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
Traditional feature spaces rely on pixel-wise characteristics and utilize the neighborhood system to establish spatial texture information. However, they fail to effectively capture the spectral-spatial features critical for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a 3D Riemannian manifold feature space (RMFS) to express contextual information by mapping the spectral features of each pixel patch to the space. In 3D RFMS, pixels from the same object exhibit a linear distribution. To leverage the geometric properties, a multi-view clustering algorithm based on slope approximation is designed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-view clustering based on 3D RMFS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both the spectral feature space and 2D RFMS for remote sensing image segmentation.
